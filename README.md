## 🔁 Reproducing the environment

This project uses [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) to ensure reproducibility.

To recreate the original R environment used in this project, open the project in RStudio and run:

```r
renv::restore()
```

This will install all packages listed in `renv.lock` inside a private project library.
